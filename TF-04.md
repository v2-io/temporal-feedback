# TF-04: The Mismatch Signal (Derived)

The discrepancy between model prediction and actual observation — the **mismatch signal** — is the fundamental driver of model adaptation.

## Definition

Given model $M_{t-1}$ and prior action $a_{t-1}$, the model generates a **prediction** of the next observation:

$$\hat{o}_t = \mathbb{E}[o_t \mid M_{t-1}, a_{t-1}]$$

or, more generally, a predictive distribution $P(o_t \mid M_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$.

The **mismatch signal**:

$$\delta_t = o_t - \hat{o}_t$$

In the distributional case, this generalizes to the score function:

$$\delta_t = -\nabla_M \log P(o_t \mid M_{t-1}, a_{t-1})$$

which points in the direction of steepest increase in the likelihood of the actual observation under the model — i.e., the direction the model should move.

## Why This Is Derived, Not Axiomatic

The mismatch signal follows from TF-02 (the model generates predictions from compressed history) and TF-01 (observations arrive from an uncertain environment). Given any model that predicts and any observation that arrives, their difference exists. The mismatch signal is not an additional assumption but a *consequence* of having a predictive model in an uncertain world.

## Properties

**Vanishing mismatch**: If the model perfectly predicts observations, $\delta_t = 0$ for all $t$. The model needs no updating (but see the ambiguity warning below).

**Decomposition**: The expected squared mismatch decomposes as:

$$\mathbb{E}[|\delta_t|^2] = \underbrace{|\hat{o}_t - \mathbb{E}[o_t \mid \Omega_t]|^2}_{\text{model error (reducible)}} + \underbrace{\text{Var}(o_t \mid \Omega_t)}_{\text{observation noise (irreducible)}}$$

The model can only drive the first term toward zero. The second term — **aleatoric uncertainty** — is a property of the observation channel, not the model. An agent that tries to eliminate all mismatch (including irreducible noise) will **overfit**: adjusting its model to explain noise, degrading future predictions.

**Information content**: The mismatch signal carries information about the gap between model and reality:

$$I(\delta_t; \Omega_t \mid M_{t-1}) > 0 \quad \text{when the model is imperfect}$$

An agent that ignores mismatch signals loses information. An agent that overreacts to them treats noise as signal. The optimal response — the update gain — is the subject of TF-05.

## The Zero-Mismatch Ambiguity

$\delta_t \approx 0$ does **not** necessarily indicate model adequacy. It indicates that predictions match observations, which may occur because:

**(a) Accurate model.** The model genuinely reflects reality. (*Desirable.*)

**(b) Insufficient exploration.** The agent is only observing aspects of the environment that its model already explains, while remaining ignorant of aspects where the model is wrong. (*Dangerous — confirmation bias.*)

**(c) Low channel resolution.** The observation channel is too noisy or low-bandwidth to detect model errors. (*Architectural limitation.*)

Only (a) is desirable. Cases (b) and (c) represent situations where the mismatch signal is **uninformative** — not because the model is good, but because the agent isn't generating observations that would *test* the model.

This ambiguity is why **active testing** — choosing actions specifically to generate informative mismatch signals — is essential. An agent that only exploits its model (acting to maximize predicted reward) will tend toward case (b). An agent that explores (acting to maximize expected information from $\delta$) will discover model errors faster.
