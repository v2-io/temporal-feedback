# TF-08: Temporal Nesting and Adaptive Tempo (Derived + Hypothesis)

Adaptive feedback operates at multiple timescales simultaneously. Faster loops are nested within slower ones, with convergence constraints between levels. The **adaptive tempo** — the product of update rate and update quality — determines an agent's capacity to persist under environmental change.

**Epistemic status**: Temporal nesting is *derived* (the convergence constraint follows from the structure of multi-timescale updating). The definition of adaptive tempo $\mathcal{T}$ is a *definition*. The mismatch dynamics equation ($d|\delta|/dt = -\mathcal{T}|\delta| + \rho$) is a *hypothesis* — a first-order linear approximation whose qualitative behavior is robust but whose quantitative form requires empirical validation and almost certainly needs nonlinear refinement. The adversarial dynamics follow from this hypothesis and inherit its epistemic status. The persistence threshold ($\mathcal{T} > \rho$) is robust to the specific functional form and is closer to *derived*.

## Temporal Nesting

An agent's adaptive processes stratify naturally by timescale:

| Timescale | Process | What changes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Fastest | Reactive response | Action given current model |
| Fast | Parametric update | Model parameters within $\mathcal{M}$ |
| Slow | Structural adaptation | Model class $\mathcal{M}$ |
| Slowest | Architectural change | The agent's fundamental structure |

Each level operates on the **quasi-steady-state output** of the level below it. This creates a convergence constraint:

$$\nu_{\text{level } n+1} \ll \nu_{\text{level } n}$$

If a slower process acts before the faster process beneath it has converged, the system oscillates — the slower process is adjusting based on transient behavior rather than settled dynamics.

### Domain Instantiations of Temporal Nesting

**PID control**: D-term (fastest, high-frequency response) → P-term (current error) → I-term (slowest, accumulated bias). These three timescales are explicit in the controller's design.

**RL**: Action selection (fastest) → Value function update (fast) → Policy improvement (slow) → Architecture change (slowest). Actor-critic methods explicitly separate the fast (critic/value) and slow (actor/policy) timescales.

**Biology**: Reflexes (ms) → Perceptual learning (minutes) → Skill acquisition (months) → Developmental change (years) → Evolutionary adaptation (generations).

**Organizations**: Operational decisions (hours) → Tactical adjustments (weeks) → Strategic revision (quarters) → Organizational restructuring (years).

**Boyd**: Tactical OODA (seconds-minutes) → Operational OODA (hours-days) → Strategic OODA (weeks-months) → Grand strategic OODA (years).

## Adaptive Tempo

Define the **adaptive tempo** of an agent:

$$\mathcal{T} = \sum_k \nu^{(k)} \cdot \eta^{(k)*}$$

where $\nu^{(k)}$ is the event rate on channel $k$ (TF-03) and $\eta^{(k)*}$ is the optimal gain on that channel (TF-05). This is the effective rate at which the agent reduces model-reality mismatch, summing the information-correction contributions across all channels.

In the **single-channel special case**, this reduces to:

$$\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*$$

combining event rate (how often the agent updates) with update quality (how effectively each update improves the model).

**Note**: $\mathcal{T}$ is identical to $\nu_{\text{eff}}$ as defined in TF-03. We use $\mathcal{T}$ in this document to emphasize its role as a *tempo* — a rate of adaptive capacity — rather than merely an effective frequency.

## The Mismatch Dynamics Equation

The evolution of model-reality mismatch over time:

$$\frac{d|\delta|}{dt} = -\mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta| + \rho(t)$$

where:
- $\mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta|$ is the rate at which the agent corrects mismatch
- $\rho(t)$ is the **environment change rate** — the rate at which new mismatch is introduced by changes in $\Omega$

### Steady-State Mismatch

In steady state ($d|\delta|/dt = 0$):

$$|\delta|_{ss} = \frac{\rho}{\mathcal{T}}$$

Steady-state mismatch is the ratio of how fast the environment changes to how fast the agent adapts.

### The Persistence Threshold

For the agent's model to remain bounded in mismatch (i.e., for the agent to persist as an adaptive system rather than degenerate into random behavior):

$$\mathcal{T} > \rho$$

Below this threshold, mismatch grows without bound — the model becomes disconnected from reality. This IS:
- **Extinction**: the environment changes faster than the organism can adapt
- **Organizational failure**: the market moves faster than the company can learn
- **Control instability**: disturbances exceed the controller's correction capacity
- **Cognitive overload**: information arrives faster than it can be processed

## Speed-Quality Substitutability

In the single-channel case ($\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*$):

- Doubling event rate $\nu$ (faster observation/action cycle) has the same effect on $|\delta|_{ss}$ as doubling update quality $\eta^*$ (better model calibration)
- Speed and quality are **substitutable** for maintaining bounded mismatch
- They are **multiplicative** when both improve: improving both by 50% yields $1.5 \times 1.5 = 2.25\times$ improvement, not $1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0\times$

This formalizes Boyd's insight that Orient quality (≈ $\eta^*$) often matters more than loop speed (≈ $\nu$): a modest improvement in update quality can compensate for a significant speed disadvantage, especially when the current $\eta^*$ is low (lots of room for improvement).

## Adversarial Dynamics

When two agents $A$ and $B$ are coupled — each agent's actions constitute part of the other's environment change rate:

$$\rho_B \approx \mathcal{T}_A \cdot |\Delta a_A| \quad \text{(A's actions change B's world)}$$
$$\rho_A \approx \mathcal{T}_B \cdot |\Delta a_B| \quad \text{(B's actions change A's world)}$$

The steady-state mismatch ratio:

$$\frac{|\delta_B|_{ss}}{|\delta_A|_{ss}} = \frac{\mathcal{T}_A}{\mathcal{T}_B}$$

When $\mathcal{T}_A > \mathcal{T}_B$: Agent B's model falls increasingly behind reality because A is changing B's environment faster than B can adapt. B is **"acting on a world that no longer exists."**

When $\mathcal{T}_A \gg \mathcal{T}_B$: B's mismatch grows without bound — B's model becomes completely disconnected from reality. This is:
- Boyd's **effects spiral** — cascading disorientation of the slower adversary
- **"Getting inside the opponent's OODA loop"** — derived here from the mathematics rather than asserted as doctrine

The formalization reveals the precision: it is the *ratio of adaptive tempos*, not merely the ratio of speeds, that determines advantage. A slower agent with vastly superior model quality ($\eta^*$) can maintain tempo parity with a faster but poorly calibrated opponent.

## Non-Adversarial Implications

In cooperative or neutral environments, $\rho$ is exogenous (the environment changes at its own rate, not influenced by the agent). The agent simply needs:

$$\mathcal{T} > \rho_{\text{environment}}$$

This gives a framework for **minimum viable adaptation**: the agent's adaptive tempo must exceed the environment's rate of change, or the model will degenerate. An organism in a slowly changing environment can persist with low $\mathcal{T}$. The same organism in a rapidly changing environment needs higher $\mathcal{T}$ — faster loops, better models, or both.

## Open Questions

1. **The mismatch dynamics equation** ($d|\delta|/dt = -\mathcal{T}|\delta| + \rho$) assumes linear mismatch reduction. In reality, large mismatches may be harder to correct than small ones (nonlinear dynamics), or large mismatches may be easier to detect and correct than subtle ones. The linear form is a first approximation; the actual dynamics may be more complex.

2. **Adversarial coupling** is simplified here as symmetric. In practice, agents may have asymmetric observability, asymmetric action impact, or delayed coupling. The general coupled case is richer.

3. **Multi-agent systems** with more than two agents create network dynamics. The pairwise analysis extends but requires network-theoretic tools.
