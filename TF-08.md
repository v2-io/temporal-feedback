# TF-08: Temporal Nesting and Adaptive Tempo (Derived + Hypothesis)

Adaptive feedback operates at multiple timescales simultaneously. Faster loops are nested within slower ones, with convergence constraints between levels. The **adaptive tempo** — the product of update rate and update quality — determines an agent's capacity to persist under environmental change.

**Epistemic status**: Temporal nesting is *derived* (the convergence constraint follows from the structure of multi-timescale updating). The definition of adaptive tempo $\mathcal{T}$ is a *definition*. The mismatch dynamics equation ($d|\delta|/dt = -\mathcal{T}|\delta| + \rho$) is a *hypothesis* — a first-order linear approximation whose qualitative behavior is robust but whose quantitative form requires empirical validation and almost certainly needs nonlinear refinement. The adversarial dynamics follow from this hypothesis and inherit its epistemic status. The persistence threshold ($\mathcal{T} > \rho$) is robust to the specific functional form and is closer to *derived*.

## Temporal Nesting

An agent's adaptive processes stratify naturally by timescale:

| Timescale | Process | What changes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Fastest | Reactive response | Action given current model |
| Fast | Parametric update | Model parameters within $\mathcal{M}$ |
| Slow | Structural adaptation | Model class $\mathcal{M}$ |
| Slowest | Architectural change | The agent's fundamental structure |

This table is illustrative, not exhaustive — real systems may have additional intermediate levels (see TF-07 for domain-specific examples). The number of distinguishable timescales is not fixed by the theory; what matters is the structural relationship between adjacent levels.

Each level operates on the **quasi-steady-state output** of the level below it. This creates a convergence constraint:

$$\nu_{\text{level } n+1} \ll \nu_{\text{level } n}$$

If a slower process acts before the faster process beneath it has converged, the system oscillates — the slower process is adjusting based on transient behavior rather than settled dynamics.

### Domain Instantiations of Temporal Nesting

**PID control**: D-term (fastest, high-frequency response) → P-term (current error) → I-term (slowest, accumulated bias). These three timescales are explicit in the controller's design.

**RL**: Action selection (fastest) → Value function update (fast) → Policy improvement (slow) → Architecture change (slowest). Actor-critic methods explicitly separate the fast (critic/value) and slow (actor/policy) timescales.

**Biology**: Reflexes (ms) → Perceptual learning (minutes) → Skill acquisition (months) → Developmental change (years) → Evolutionary adaptation (generations).

**Organizations**: Operational decisions (hours) → Tactical adjustments (weeks) → Strategic revision (quarters) → Organizational restructuring (years).

**Boyd**: Tactical OODA (seconds-minutes) → Operational OODA (hours-days) → Strategic OODA (weeks-months) → Grand strategic OODA (years).

## Adaptive Tempo

Define the **adaptive tempo** of an agent:

$$\mathcal{T} = \sum_k \nu^{(k)} \cdot \eta^{(k)*}$$

where $\nu^{(k)}$ is the event rate on channel $k$ (TF-03) and $\eta^{(k)*}$ is the optimal gain on that channel (TF-05). This is the effective rate at which the agent reduces model-reality mismatch, summing the information-correction contributions across all channels.

In the **single-channel special case**, this reduces to:

$$\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*$$

combining event rate (how often the agent updates) with update quality (how effectively each update improves the model).

**Note**: $\mathcal{T}$ is identical to $\nu_{\text{eff}}$ as defined in TF-03. We use $\mathcal{T}$ in this document to emphasize its role as a *tempo* — a rate of adaptive capacity — rather than merely an effective frequency.

## The Mismatch Dynamics Equation

The evolution of model-reality mismatch over time:

$$\frac{d|\delta|}{dt} = -\mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta| + \rho(t)$$

where:
- $\mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta|$ is the rate at which the agent corrects mismatch
- $\rho(t)$ is the **environment change rate** — the rate at which new mismatch is introduced by changes in $\Omega$

### Steady-State Mismatch

In steady state ($d|\delta|/dt = 0$):

$$|\delta|_{ss} = \frac{\rho}{\mathcal{T}}$$

Steady-state mismatch is the ratio of how fast the environment changes to how fast the agent adapts.

### Proposition 8.1: The Persistence Threshold

**Statement.** Under the linear mismatch dynamics hypothesis above, steady-state mismatch is bounded and inversely proportional to adaptive tempo. The agent's model remains *functionally adequate* (mismatch below a critical threshold) if and only if $\mathcal{T}$ is sufficiently large relative to $\rho$.

**Assumptions.**
1. Mismatch evolves as $d|\delta|/dt = -\mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta| + \rho$ with $\mathcal{T}, \rho > 0$ constant. *(Hypothesis — see epistemic status note.)*
2. $|\delta(0)| = |\delta_0| \geq 0$ (finite initial mismatch).

**Proof sketch.**

This is a first-order linear ODE. Its solution is:

$$|\delta(t)| = |\delta_0| e^{-\mathcal{T} t} + \frac{\rho}{\mathcal{T}}(1 - e^{-\mathcal{T} t})$$

As $t \to \infty$: $|\delta(t)| \to \rho / \mathcal{T}$, which is finite for any $\mathcal{T} > 0$.

**The persistence condition.** Under the linear ODE, mismatch is always bounded — but it may be bounded at a level so high that the model cannot support effective action. Let $|\delta_{\text{critical}}|$ be the threshold beyond which the model is functionally useless (connected to TF-07's structural adaptation trigger and Appendix A's sector-condition radius $R$). Then functional persistence requires:

$$\frac{\rho}{\mathcal{T}} < |\delta_{\text{critical}}| \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \mathcal{T} > \frac{\rho}{|\delta_{\text{critical}}|}$$

When $|\delta_{\text{critical}}|$ is normalized to 1 (or equivalently, when $\rho$ and $\mathcal{T}$ are measured in units of the critical mismatch), this reduces to $\mathcal{T} > \rho$.

**The stronger claim for nonlinear/adversarial dynamics.** The linear ODE always yields bounded mismatch, but real correction dynamics are nonlinear. When the correction function saturates at large $|\delta|$ (see Open Question #1) or when $\rho$ is itself a function of $|\delta|$ (as in the adversarial case where the opponent exploits mismatch), unbounded mismatch growth becomes possible. In these cases, $\mathcal{T} > \rho$ (appropriately generalized) becomes necessary for stability, not merely for keeping steady-state error small. [Appendix A](Appendix-A-Lyapunov.md) formalizes this: Proposition A.1 proves bounded mismatch under general nonlinear dynamics using a sector condition, with the persistence threshold $\alpha > \rho/R$ replacing the linear $\mathcal{T} > \rho$. $\square$

**Robustness note.** The persistence threshold $\mathcal{T} > \rho$ is *more robust* than the linear dynamics from which it is derived. Any reasonable mismatch dynamics — whether the correction term is linear, concave, or convex in $|\delta|$ — will have a threshold beyond which adaptation cannot keep pace with environmental change. The linear form gives the cleanest expression; the qualitative conclusion holds for any monotone correction function. [Appendix A](Appendix-A-Lyapunov.md) formalizes this robustness via Lyapunov stability analysis, proving bounded mismatch (Proposition A.1) and the persistence threshold under general nonlinear correction dynamics satisfying a sector condition — without requiring the linear hypothesis.

Below this threshold — whether because $\mathcal{T}$ is too low, $\rho$ too high, or the correction function saturates — the model cannot support effective action. In nonlinear or adversarial dynamics, mismatch can grow without bound (Appendix A). This IS:
- **Extinction**: the environment changes faster than the organism can adapt
- **Organizational failure**: the market moves faster than the company can learn
- **Control instability**: disturbances exceed the controller's correction capacity
- **Cognitive overload**: information arrives faster than it can be processed

## Speed-Quality Substitutability

In the single-channel case ($\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*$):

- Doubling event rate $\nu$ (faster observation/action cycle) has the same effect on $|\delta|_{ss}$ as doubling update quality $\eta^*$ (better model calibration)
- Speed and quality are **substitutable** for maintaining bounded mismatch
- They are **multiplicative** when both improve: improving both by 50% yields $1.5 \times 1.5 = 2.25\times$ improvement, not $1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0\times$

This formalizes Boyd's insight that Orient quality (≈ $\eta^*$) often matters more than loop speed (≈ $\nu$): a modest improvement in update quality can compensate for a significant speed disadvantage, especially when the current $\eta^*$ is low (lots of room for improvement).

## Adversarial Dynamics

When two agents $A$ and $B$ are coupled — each agent's actions constitute part of the other's environment change rate:

$$\rho_B \approx \mathcal{T}_A \cdot |\Delta a_A| \quad \text{(A's actions change B's world)}$$
$$\rho_A \approx \mathcal{T}_B \cdot |\Delta a_B| \quad \text{(B's actions change A's world)}$$

The steady-state mismatch ratio:

$$\frac{|\delta_B|_{ss}}{|\delta_A|_{ss}} = \frac{\mathcal{T}_A}{\mathcal{T}_B}$$

When $\mathcal{T}_A > \mathcal{T}_B$: Agent B's model falls increasingly behind reality because A is changing B's environment faster than B can adapt. B is acting on a world that no longer exists.

When $\mathcal{T}_A \gg \mathcal{T}_B$: B's mismatch grows without bound — B's model becomes completely disconnected from reality. This is:
- Boyd's **effects spiral** — cascading disorientation of the slower adversary
- **"Getting inside the opponent's OODA loop"** — derived here from the formal structure rather than argued qualitatively

The formalization reveals the precision: it is the *ratio of adaptive tempos*, not merely the ratio of speeds, that determines advantage. A slower agent with vastly superior model quality ($\eta^*$) can maintain tempo parity with a faster but poorly calibrated opponent.

[Appendix A](Appendix-A-Lyapunov.md) extends this analysis beyond the linear case: Proposition A.3 shows that adversarial destabilization occurs when one agent's effective disruption ($\gamma_A \cdot \mathcal{T}_A$) exceeds the other's *adaptive reserve* ($\Delta\rho^*_B$) — capturing asymmetric coupling, finite model-class capacity, and structural collapse. Corollary A.3.1 formalizes the effects spiral as a positive-feedback Lyapunov instability. Note that the adversarial coupling $\gamma_A$ can operate through *communicative* channels — deception, disinformation, strategic ambiguity — not only through physical action on the environment; see TF-06's discussion of adversarial query dynamics.

## Non-Adversarial Implications

In cooperative or neutral environments, $\rho$ is exogenous (the environment changes at its own rate, not influenced by the agent). The agent simply needs:

$$\mathcal{T} > \rho_{\text{environment}}$$

This gives a framework for **minimum viable adaptation**: the agent's adaptive tempo must exceed the environment's rate of change, or the model will degenerate. An organism in a slowly changing environment can persist with low $\mathcal{T}$. The same organism in a rapidly changing environment needs higher $\mathcal{T}$ — faster loops, better models, or both.

## Open Questions

1. **The mismatch dynamics equation** ($d|\delta|/dt = -\mathcal{T}|\delta| + \rho$) is a first-order linear approximation. The true correction dynamics are almost certainly nonlinear: $d|\delta|/dt = -F(\mathcal{T}, |\delta|) + \rho(t)$. Plausible nonlinearities include:
   - **Saturation at large $|\delta|$**: When mismatch is massive, the agent's update mechanism may be overwhelmed (the gain $\eta^*$ was derived for small perturbations), yielding $F(\mathcal{T}, |\delta|) < \mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta|$ — correction is *slower* than linear for large errors. This would make the persistence threshold *harder* to satisfy than the linear form suggests.
   - **Threshold effects**: Below some detection threshold, small mismatches may go uncorrected ($F \approx 0$ for $|\delta| < \epsilon$), creating a "dead zone" where the model drifts slowly.
   - **Structural breakdown**: Beyond some critical $|\delta|$, the correction rate drops to zero because the model class is no longer appropriate (TF-07), requiring structural adaptation before parametric correction can resume.

   The linear form $F = \mathcal{T} \cdot |\delta|$ is best understood as a local Taylor approximation valid near the steady state. Proposition 8.1's persistence threshold is robust to the specific form of $F$ (see robustness note) because any monotone correction function has a capacity limit. But the *quantitative* predictions (exact steady-state value, convergence rate) are specific to the linear case. [Appendix A](Appendix-A-Lyapunov.md) provides a Lyapunov stability analysis that proves persistence results without committing to a specific $F$, requiring only a sector condition on the correction function. The Lyapunov approach also yields the concept of *adaptive reserve* (Proposition A.2) and a formal treatment of adversarial destabilization (Proposition A.3) that is richer than the linear steady-state ratio derived above.

2. **Adversarial coupling** is simplified here as symmetric. In practice, agents may have asymmetric observability, asymmetric action impact, or delayed coupling. The general coupled case is richer.

3. **Multi-agent systems** with more than two agents create network dynamics. The pairwise analysis extends but requires network-theoretic tools.

4. **Tempo as a tensor, not a scalar.** The scalar $\mathcal{T}$ implicitly assumes the agent's adaptive capacity is uniform across all dimensions of environment state. In complex systems, an agent may have high tempo along some dimensions (e.g., fast tactical reflexes) but low tempo along others (e.g., slow strategic foresight). When $\rho$ is concentrated along the low-tempo dimensions, the scalar $\mathcal{T}$ overestimates the agent's effective adaptation. A more complete formulation would define a tempo matrix $\mathbf{T}$ and require $T_{ii} > \rho_i$ per-dimension, or more generally that $\mathbf{T} - \text{diag}(\boldsymbol{\rho})$ is positive definite. The scalar treatment remains valid when the agent's adaptive capacity is roughly isotropic or when the environment change rate is roughly uniform across dimensions. This extension is deferred but noted as a known limitation.
