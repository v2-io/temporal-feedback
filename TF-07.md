# TF-07: Structural Adaptation (Derived + Empirical)

Incremental model updating (TF-05) adjusts parameters within a fixed model class $\mathcal{M}$. When the model class itself is inadequate — when no model in $\mathcal{M}$ can serve as a good sufficient statistic for the environment — the agent requires **structural adaptation**: changing $\mathcal{M}$.

**Epistemic status**: The *necessity* of structural adaptation is *derived* from TF-02 (model class fitness) and TF-05 (parametric updating is insufficient when $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})$ is low). The six-phase destruction-creation cycle is an *empirical pattern* observed across domains (Boyd, Kuhn, evolution, ML) — plausible and well-supported but not formally derived. The cost analysis is *discussion*.

## The Two Levels of Adaptation

**Parametric adaptation** (TF-05): $M_t$ changes within fixed $\mathcal{M}$.
$$M_t = f(M_{t-1}, o_t, a_{t-1}) \quad M_t \in \mathcal{M}$$

**Structural adaptation** (this theorem): $\mathcal{M}$ itself changes.
$$\mathcal{M}_{t+1} = F(\mathcal{M}_t, \text{performance history})$$

The agent's full adaptive state is therefore the pair $(\mathcal{M}_t, M_t)$, evolving at different timescales.

## When Structural Adaptation Is Needed

From TF-02, model class fitness is:

$$\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}) = \sup_{M \in \mathcal{M}} S(M)$$

When $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M})$ is low, no model in $\mathcal{M}$ can adequately compress the interaction history. Symptoms:

1. **Persistent irreducible mismatch**: $|\delta_t|$ remains large despite extended updating — the model has converged within $\mathcal{M}$ but the best achievable model is still poor.

2. **Gain collapse without performance**: $\eta^*$ has decreased (model appears confident) but predictions remain inaccurate — the model is confidently wrong, having fitted to structure in $\mathcal{M}$ that doesn't match reality.

3. **Systematic mismatch patterns**: $\delta_t$ shows structure (correlations, trends, periodicities) that the model class cannot represent — the residuals contain signal that $\mathcal{M}$ lacks the capacity to absorb.

## Destruction and Creation

Structural adaptation requires **destroying** the current model structure and **creating** a new one from more fundamental elements. This is:

- **Boyd**: "Destruction and creation" — tearing apart existing mental models and synthesizing new ones from the pieces
- **Kuhn**: Paradigm shift — abandoning the current paradigm when anomalies accumulate beyond what normal science can resolve
- **Popper**: Conjecture and refutation — the bold conjecture of a new theory replacing a falsified one
- **ML**: Neural architecture search, hyperparameter optimization — changing the structure of the model, not just its weights
- **Evolution**: Speciation — new body plans, not just allele frequency changes
- **Organizations**: Strategic pivot — changing the business model, not just optimizing the current one

## The Destruction-Creation Cycle

The dynamics of structural adaptation have a characteristic pattern:

**Phase 1 — Anomaly accumulation**: Mismatch signals persist despite parametric adaptation. $|\delta|$ converges to a floor above zero. The agent's performance plateaus.

**Phase 2 — Recognition**: The agent (or meta-process) detects that the residual mismatch is structural, not parametric. This requires a higher-level mismatch signal — mismatch about the mismatch, a *meta-observation* that the model class is failing.

**Phase 3 — Destruction**: The current model $M_t \in \mathcal{M}$ is abandoned. This is costly — accumulated knowledge embedded in $M_t$'s parameters is partially or fully lost.

**Phase 4 — Exploration of model classes**: New candidates $\mathcal{M}'$ are considered. This may be random (evolutionary mutation), systematic (architecture search), or insight-driven (scientific creativity).

**Phase 5 — Creation**: A new model class $\mathcal{M}'$ is selected and a new model $M'_0 \in \mathcal{M}'$ is initialized.

**Phase 6 — Rapid parametric adaptation**: Because $M'_0$ is newly initialized, model uncertainty $U_M$ is high, so $\eta^*$ is large (TF-05). The model learns rapidly in the new structure.

## The Cost of Structural Change

Structural adaptation is expensive:
- **Knowledge loss**: Parameters learned within $\mathcal{M}$ may not transfer to $\mathcal{M}'$
- **Temporary performance drop**: The new model starts uncertain; performance degrades before improving
- **Search cost**: Finding good $\mathcal{M}'$ may require exploring many candidates
- **Coordination cost**: In multi-agent or organizational systems, structural change requires collective reorientation

This cost creates a rational **conservatism** — agents should prefer parametric adaptation when it suffices, and resort to structural adaptation only when the evidence for model class inadequacy is strong. Premature structural change wastes accumulated knowledge. Delayed structural change accumulates mismatch.

The optimal threshold for structural adaptation is itself an open problem, analogous to the explore-exploit trade-off (TF-06) but at a higher level.

## Temporal Nesting of Adaptation

Parametric and structural adaptation operate at different timescales:

$$\nu_{\text{parametric}} \gg \nu_{\text{structural}}$$

Fast parametric loops must approximately converge *within* each structural epoch. If structural changes occur too frequently, parametric adaptation never converges. If too infrequently, the agent is trapped in an inadequate model class.

This is one instance of the general temporal nesting principle (TF-08): faster processes nested within slower ones, with convergence constraints between levels.
