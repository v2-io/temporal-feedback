# Appendix E: TFT Core — Minimal Formal Path

**Purpose.** This appendix presents the core theorem chain of Temporal Feedback Theory in condensed form: one scope definition, one formulation, five propositions, and the key definitions connecting them. No extended discussion, domain instantiations, or open questions. For full development, see the individual TF documents. For notation, see [TF-00](TF-00.md).

## 1. Scope (TF-01)

TFT applies to any agent-environment pair where the agent observes, acts, and faces residual uncertainty:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{TFT}} = \{(Agent, \Omega) : \mathcal{O} \neq \emptyset, \; \mathcal{A} \neq \emptyset, \; H(\Omega_t \mid \mathcal{H}_t) > 0 \}$$

Observations are lossy: $o_t = h(\Omega_t, a_{t-1}, \varepsilon_t)$. Actions affect the environment: $\Omega_{t+1} \sim T(\cdot \mid \Omega_t, a_t)$.

## 2. The Model (TF-03, Formulation)

Any persisting agent is analyzed as maintaining a **model** $M_t = \phi(\mathcal{H}_t) \in \mathcal{M}$ — a compression of its interaction history.

**Model sufficiency:**
$$S(M_t) = 1 - \frac{I(\mathcal{H}_t;\, o_{t+1:\infty} \mid M_t, a_{t:\infty})}{I(\mathcal{H}_t;\, o_{t+1:\infty} \mid a_{t:\infty})} \in [0,1]$$

When $S \approx 1$, the model supports recursive updating: $M_t = f(M_{t-1}, o_t, a_{t-1})$.

**Model class fitness:** $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}) = \sup_{M \in \mathcal{M}} S(M)$. The best achievable sufficiency given the model class.

## 3. The Mismatch Signal (TF-05, Derived)

The model predicts; reality delivers. Their difference is the mismatch:

$$\delta_t = o_t - \hat{o}_t, \quad \hat{o}_t = \mathbb{E}[o_t \mid M_{t-1}, a_{t-1}]$$

**Proposition 5.1 (Mismatch Inevitability).** For any $(Agent, \Omega) \in \mathcal{S}_{\text{TFT}}$:

$$\mathbb{E}[\|\delta_t\|^2] = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\|\hat{o}_t - \bar{o}_t\|^2]}_{\text{model error (reducible)}} + \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[\text{Var}(o_t \mid \Omega_t, a_{t-1})]}_{\text{observation noise (irreducible)}} > 0$$

whenever observation noise is non-degenerate or the model's predictive mean is misspecified.

## 4. The Update Gain (TF-06, Empirical Claim)

The model incorporates mismatch through: $M_t = M_{t-1} + \eta(M_{t-1}) \cdot g(\delta_t)$.

**Uncertainty ratio principle.** The optimal gain has the structural form:

$$\eta^* = \frac{U_M}{U_M + U_o}$$

where $U_M = \text{Var}_{M_{t-1}}[\hat{o}_t \mid a_{t-1}]$ (model uncertainty) and $U_o = \text{Var}[\varepsilon_t]$ (observation uncertainty). Exact for Kalman and conjugate Bayesian systems; structural form validated approximately across RL, PID, and organizational adaptation.

## 5. Adaptive Tempo and Persistence (TF-11, Derived + Hypothesis)

**Adaptive tempo** (the effective rate at which the agent reduces mismatch):

$$\mathcal{T} = \sum_k \nu^{(k)} \cdot \eta^{(k)*}$$

**Mismatch dynamics** (hypothesis — linear approximation):

$$\frac{d\|\delta\|}{dt} = -\mathcal{T} \cdot \|\delta\| + \rho(t)$$

**Proposition 11.1 (Persistence Threshold).** Steady-state mismatch $\|\delta\|_{ss} = \rho/\mathcal{T}$. The model remains functionally adequate iff:

$$\mathcal{T} > \frac{\rho}{\|\delta_{\text{critical}}\|}$$

**Corollary 11.2 (Squared Tempo Advantage).** Under adversarial coupling with negligible base disturbance, steady-state mismatch ratios scale as:

$$\frac{\|\delta_B\|_{ss}}{\|\delta_A\|_{ss}} = \frac{\gamma_A}{\gamma_B}\left(\frac{\mathcal{T}_A}{\mathcal{T}_B}\right)^2$$

## 6. Lyapunov Generalization (Appendix A, Derived)

The linear hypothesis is replaced by a **sector condition**: $\delta^T F(\mathcal{T}, \delta) \geq \alpha\|\delta\|^2$ for $\|\delta\| \leq R$.

**Proposition A.1 (Bounded Mismatch).** Under the sector condition with bounded disturbance $\|w(t)\| \leq \rho$: mismatch is ultimately bounded by $R^* = \rho/\alpha$. The agent persists iff $\alpha > \rho/R$.

**Proposition A.2 (Adaptive Reserve).** The agent can absorb additional disturbance $\Delta\rho^* = \alpha R - \rho$ without mismatch diverging.

**Proposition A.3 (Adversarial Destabilization).** Agent $A$ drives Agent $B$ past its stability boundary when $\gamma_A \cdot \mathcal{T}_A > \Delta\rho^*_B$.

**Corollary A.3.1 (Effects Spiral).** Post-destabilization, $B$'s degrading model increases $A$'s coupling effectiveness, creating a positive-feedback Lyapunov instability.

## 7. Structural Adaptation Trigger (TF-10, Derived)

**Proposition 10.1 (Structural Adaptation Necessity).** If $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{M}) < 1 - \epsilon$, no parametric adaptation within $\mathcal{M}$ can reduce mismatch below a floor determined by $\epsilon$. Persistent structured residuals after parametric convergence are diagnostic of model class inadequacy.

## Dependency Chain

```
TF-01 (scope) → TF-03 (model, formulation) → TF-05 (mismatch, Prop 5.1)
    → TF-06 (gain, empirical claim) → TF-11 (tempo, Props 11.1 + 11.2)
    → Appendix A (Lyapunov, Props A.1–A.3, Cor. A.3.1)
TF-03 + TF-05 → TF-10 (structural adaptation, Prop 10.1)
```
