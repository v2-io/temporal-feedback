## Conventions

**Subscript $t$**: Discrete time index. Used when events arrive uniformly on a single channel.

**Subscript $\tau$**: Continuous time. Used in the event-driven formulation (TF-04).

**Superscript $(k)$**: Channel index. Distinguishes observation or action channels with distinct rates and noise characteristics.

**Calligraphic letters** ($\mathcal{M}$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{E}$, $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{T}$): Sets, spaces, or aggregate quantities. Exception: $\mathcal{T}$ is a scalar rate, not a set — the calligraphic is used to distinguish adaptive tempo from temperature or other common uses of $T$.

**$\lvert \cdot \rvert$**: Norm of a vector (for mismatch magnitude) or cardinality of a set, determined by context.

## Units (Informal)

The theory is stated in natural (dimensionless information-theoretic) units where possible:

- $\eta^*$: Dimensionless ratio in $[0, 1]$
- $\nu^{(k)}$: Events per unit time (Hz)
- $\mathcal{T}$: Inverse time ($t^{-1}$). Informally: "effective correction rate."
- $\rho$: Mismatch per unit time ([surprise] $\cdot t^{-1}$). Rate at which new mismatch is introduced.
- $S(M_t)$: Dimensionless ratio in $[0, 1]$

**Dimensional analysis of the mismatch ODE.** In $d\lvert\delta\rvert/dt = -\mathcal{T}\lvert\delta\rvert + \rho$: the LHS has units [surprise $\cdot t^{-1}$]; the term $\mathcal{T}\lvert\delta\rvert$ has units $[t^{-1}] \cdot [\text{surprise}] = [\text{surprise} \cdot t^{-1}]$; and $\rho$ has units $[\text{surprise} \cdot t^{-1}]$. All terms are consistent. Note that $\mathcal{T}$ and $\rho$ have *different* units — the shorthand "$\mathcal{T} > \rho$" used in TF-11 is the normalized form where $|\delta|$ is measured in units of the critical mismatch threshold $|\delta_{\text{critical}}|$ (making $|\delta|$ dimensionless). The full persistence condition is $\mathcal{T} > \rho / |\delta_{\text{critical}}|$, which is dimensionally consistent.

## Dependency Structure

The theory's documents form a directed dependency graph. Each document depends on the axioms and definitions established before it; cross-links indicate where later documents reference earlier material beyond the primary chain.

**Primary chain:**

```
TF-01 (Scope) → TF-02 (Causal Structure) → TF-03 (Model) → TF-04 (Dynamics)
    → TF-05 (Mismatch) → TF-06 (Update Gain) → TF-07 (Action Selection)
    → TF-09 (Deliberation Cost) → TF-10 (Structural Adaptation) → TF-11 (Tempo)
    → Appendix A (Lyapunov Stability)
```

**Key cross-links:**

- TF-05 → TF-01 + TF-03 (Prop 5.1 derives mismatch from scope + model formulation)
- TF-07 → TF-02 (CIY from causal axiom drives exploration)
- TF-09 → TF-06 + TF-11 (deliberation cost depends on gain and tempo)
- TF-10 → TF-03 (structural adaptation changes model class from model formulation)
- TF-11 → TF-06 (adaptive tempo = rate × gain)
- Appendix A → TF-11 (generalizes linear dynamics to nonlinear Lyapunov)

## Formal Results Index

The theory contains formal propositions (stated with explicit assumptions and proof sketches) alongside discussion-grade claims (argued qualitatively or by analogy). This index distinguishes them.

| Speed-quality substitutability | TF-11 | Follows from $\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*$; qualitative implication |
| Action fluency concept | TF-07 | Characterized via deliberation gain ($\Delta\eta^* \approx 0 \Rightarrow$ high fluency) |
