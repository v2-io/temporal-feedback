## Conventions

**Subscript $t$**: Discrete time index when events arrive uniformly on a single channel. Also used as continuous macroscopic time in the mismatch dynamics ODEs (TF-11, Appendix A), where the differential equations abstract over the microscopic event-driven updates at timestamps $\tau$ (TF-04). Context disambiguates: $M_t = f(M_{t-1}, o_t, a_{t-1})$ is discrete; $d\|\delta\|/dt$ is continuous.

**Subscript $\tau$**: Continuous timestamp of an individual event. Used in the event-driven formulation (TF-04) for microscopic update dynamics.

**Superscript $(k)$**: Channel index. Distinguishes observation or action channels with distinct rates and noise characteristics.

**Calligraphic letters** ($\mathcal{M}$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{E}$, $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{T}$, $\mathcal{I}$): Sets, spaces, or aggregate quantities. Exceptions: $\mathcal{T}$ is a scalar rate, not a set — the calligraphic distinguishes adaptive tempo from temperature or other common uses of $T$. $\mathcal{I}(e_\tau)$ is a scalar (event information content) — the calligraphic distinguishes it from the mutual information functional $I(\cdot;\cdot)$.

**$\| \cdot \|$**: Norm (Euclidean or information-theoretic) of a vector. Used for mismatch magnitude throughout.

**$\lvert \cdot \rvert$**: Cardinality of a set (e.g., $|\mathcal{A}|$). Not used for mismatch magnitude — use $\|\cdot\|$ instead.

**Scalar reduction of gain and tempo.** When $\eta^*$ appears as a scalar in the mismatch dynamics (TF-11, Appendix A), it represents the effective correction fraction along the current mismatch direction: $\eta^*_{\text{eff}} = \delta^T K \delta / \|\delta\|^2$ where $K$ is the full gain operator. The scalar adaptive tempo $\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*_{\text{eff}}$ is the correction rate along this direction. The sector condition parameter $\alpha$ in Appendix A corresponds to the worst-case scalar projection: $\alpha = \inf_{\delta \neq 0} \delta^T F(\mathcal{T}, \delta) / \|\delta\|^2$. The full anisotropic treatment would require a tempo tensor (TF-11 Open Question #4); the scalar reduction is valid when correction dynamics are approximately isotropic or when $\rho$ is roughly uniform across mismatch dimensions.

## Units (Informal)

The theory is stated in natural (dimensionless information-theoretic) units where possible:

- $\eta^*$: Dimensionless ratio in $[0, 1]$
- $\nu^{(k)}$: Events per unit time (Hz)
- $\mathcal{T}$: Inverse time ($t^{-1}$). Informally: "effective correction rate."
- $\rho$: Mismatch per unit time ([surprise] $\cdot t^{-1}$). Rate at which new mismatch is introduced.
- $S(M_t)$: Dimensionless ratio in $[0, 1]$

**Dimensional analysis of the mismatch ODE.** In $d\|\delta\|/dt = -\mathcal{T}\|\delta\| + \rho$: the LHS has units [surprise $\cdot t^{-1}$]; the term $\mathcal{T}\|\delta\|$ has units $[t^{-1}] \cdot [\text{surprise}] = [\text{surprise} \cdot t^{-1}]$; and $\rho$ has units $[\text{surprise} \cdot t^{-1}]$. All terms are consistent. Note that $\mathcal{T}$ and $\rho$ have *different* units — they are not directly comparable. The **persistence condition** is $\mathcal{T} > \rho / \|\delta_{\text{critical}}\|$, which is dimensionally consistent ($[t^{-1}] > [\text{surprise} \cdot t^{-1}] / [\text{surprise}]$). When $\|\delta_{\text{critical}}\|$ is normalized to 1, this reduces to the shorthand "$\mathcal{T} > \rho$" — but this notation is only valid under that normalization. All formal statements in TFT use the full form; the shorthand appears only after explicit definition (TF-11).

## Dependency Structure

The theory's documents form a directed dependency graph. Each document depends on the axioms and definitions established before it; cross-links indicate where later documents reference earlier material beyond the primary chain.

### Primary Chain

```
TF-01 (Scope) → TF-02 (Causal Structure) → TF-03 (Model) → TF-04 (Dynamics)
    → TF-05 (Mismatch) → TF-06 (Update Gain) → TF-07 (Action Selection)
    → TF-08 (Exploration-Exploitation) → TF-09 (Deliberation Cost)
    → TF-10 (Structural Adaptation) → TF-11 (Tempo)
    → Appendix A (Lyapunov Stability)
    → Appendix B (Estimation Procedures)
    → Appendices C, D (Worked Examples)
```

**Note on TF-08.** TF-08 is hypothesis + discussion — it contains no formal propositions but provides the conceptual bridge between action selection (TF-07) and adversarial dynamics (TF-11, Appendix A). Downstream documents that reference CIY in policy objectives or adversarial coupling depend on it conceptually, though the formal results (Propositions 9.1, 11.1, A.1–A.3) do not require it.

### Key Cross-Links

- TF-05 → TF-01 + TF-03 (Prop 5.1 derives mismatch from scope + model formulation)
- TF-07 → TF-02 (CIY from causal axiom drives exploration)
- TF-09 → TF-06 + Assumption 9.0 (local deliberation drift; TF-11 later provides global consistency)
- TF-10 → TF-03 (structural adaptation changes model class from model formulation)
- TF-10 → TF-09 (structural change cost as massive deliberation cost)
- TF-11 → TF-06 (adaptive tempo = rate × gain)
- Appendix A → TF-11 (generalizes linear dynamics to nonlinear Lyapunov)
- Appendix B → TF-06 + TF-09 + TF-11 + App. A (estimation procedures)
- Appendix C → TF-01 through App. A (Kalman worked example — exact mapping)
- Appendix D → TF-01 through TF-11 (RL worked example — approximate mapping)
- Appendix F → TF-06 + TF-08 + TF-11 + App. A (multi-agent coupling, strategic interaction)

## Formal Results Index

The theory contains formal propositions (stated with explicit assumptions and proof sketches) alongside discussion-grade claims (argued qualitatively or by analogy). This index distinguishes them.

### Propositions *(stated and proved/sketched under explicit assumptions)*

| Result | Location | Depends on | Status | Robustness |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| Prop 5.1: Mismatch Inevitability | TF-05 | TF-01, TF-03 | Proved (sketch) | **Robust** — requires only scope + model |
| Prop 9.1: Deliberation Threshold | TF-09 | TF-07, TF-06, Asm 9.0 | Proved (sketch) | **Conditional** — on local drift assumption |
| Prop 10.1: Structural Adaptation Necessity | TF-10 | TF-03, TF-05 | Proved (sketch) | **Robust** — pure information-theoretic |
| Prop 11.1: Persistence Threshold | TF-11 | TF-06, TF-04 | Proved (linear); generalized by A.1 | **Linear-dependent** — qualitative result robust (A.1) |
| Cor. 11.2: Squared Tempo Advantage | TF-11 | Linear ODE + linear coupling | Derived | **Linear-dependent** — first-order heuristic |
| Prop A.1: Bounded Mismatch | App. A | Sector condition | Proved | **Robust** — general nonlinear |
| Prop A.2: Adaptive Reserve | App. A | A.1 | Proved (corollary) | **Robust** — general nonlinear |
| Prop A.3: Adversarial Destabilization | App. A | A.1, coupling model | Proved | **Robust** (with decoupling caveat) |
| Cor. A.3.1: Effects Spiral | App. A | A.3 | Proved (corollary) | **Robust** — positive feedback mechanism |

**Robustness key**: **Robust** = holds under general nonlinear dynamics or pure information-theoretic assumptions. **Linear-dependent** = derived from the linear mismatch dynamics hypothesis; qualitative conclusion may survive but quantitative form is approximate. **Conditional** = depends on explicitly named local assumptions.

### Discussion-Grade Claims *(argued but not formally derived)*

| Claim | Location | Nature |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Uncertainty ratio principle ($\eta^* = U_M/(U_M + U_o)$) | TF-06 | Empirical; exact in Kalman/conjugate Bayes, structural elsewhere |
| Unified policy objective ($\pi^* = \arg\max[\text{value} + \lambda \cdot \text{CIY}]$) | TF-08 | Structural analogy with active inference; $\lambda$ not derived |
| Speed-quality substitutability | TF-11 | Follows from $\mathcal{T} = \nu \cdot \eta^*$; qualitative implication |
| Action fluency concept | TF-07 | Characterized via deliberation gain ($\Delta\eta^* \approx 0 \Rightarrow$ high fluency) |
| Non-forkability of causal trajectories | TF-02 | Conceptual argument from sufficiency + temporal ordering |
