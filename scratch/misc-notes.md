Before they become too entrenched, let's renumber or consider the numbering and order

Is there a need to distinguish the concept of "active solicitation" or queries as an explicitly analyzed action, or is it too obvious or already discussed/subsumed? The idea being that there can be very high-level model update or even structural change derived from the result of, for example, asking someone who is known to be trustworthy a question-- probably starting to get into decision theory and game theory a bit...  I just don't want to get stuck in thinking that there are only lower-level probe-like options available-- and that if higher level thought actions (as in, extremely information-dense intelligence that can be queried via semantic language) are available, those would naturally be preferred. (For example, the probably mythical tale of Niels Bohr being asked in school how to measure the height of a building with a barometer, and answering with 5+ different ways, finally concluding:
But since we are continually being urged to seek new ways of doing things, probably the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say: "If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this building'."
