# TF-06.5: The Cost of Deliberation (Derived)

Explicit deliberation (TF-06) improves action quality by using the model for internal simulation before acting. But deliberation takes time — and during that time, the environment continues to evolve. This creates a fundamental trade-off between action quality and action timeliness.

**Epistemic status**: *Derived* from TF-06 (action selection), TF-08 (mismatch dynamics), and TF-03 (event-driven dynamics). The threshold condition (Proposition 6.5.1) follows cleanly from the mismatch dynamics hypothesis. The specific functional forms for $\Delta\eta^*$ are domain-dependent and less certain.

## The Deliberation Trade-off

When an agent deliberates for duration $\Delta\tau$:

**Benefit**: The quality of the subsequent action improves. Specifically, the effective update gain on the *next* update cycle increases by $\Delta\eta^*(\Delta\tau)$ — the agent's model-based simulation has refined its predictions and action selection, leading to better mismatch correction when it does act.

**Cost**: During $\Delta\tau$, the environment evolves at rate $\rho$, introducing new mismatch that the agent is not correcting (because it is deliberating, not acting). The accumulated mismatch during deliberation is:

$$\Delta|\delta|_{\text{deliberation}} = \rho \cdot \Delta\tau$$

## Proposition 6.5.1: Deliberation Threshold

**Statement.** Deliberation of duration $\Delta\tau$ is net-beneficial if and only if the improvement in post-deliberation adaptation exceeds the mismatch accumulated during deliberation:

$$\Delta\eta^*(\Delta\tau) \cdot |\delta_{\text{post}}| > \rho \cdot \Delta\tau$$

where $|\delta_{\text{post}}|$ is the mismatch magnitude the agent will face when it resumes acting.

**Proof sketch.**

1. Without deliberation, the agent acts immediately. Its mismatch correction rate is $\mathcal{T}_0 = \nu \cdot \eta^*_0$ (its current tempo).

2. With deliberation of duration $\Delta\tau$, the agent pauses, then acts with improved gain $\eta^*_0 + \Delta\eta^*$. But during the pause, mismatch has grown by $\rho \cdot \Delta\tau$.

3. The net mismatch *reduction* from acting after deliberation versus acting immediately is:

$$\text{Net} = \underbrace{\Delta\eta^* \cdot |\delta_{\text{post}}|}_{\text{better correction}} - \underbrace{\rho \cdot \Delta\tau}_{\text{accumulated drift}}$$

4. Deliberation is justified iff $\text{Net} > 0$. $\square$

## Consequences

### High-$\rho$ environments penalize deliberation

When the environment is changing rapidly ($\rho$ large), the cost term $\rho \cdot \Delta\tau$ grows quickly. Only *very* short deliberation with *large* $\Delta\eta^*$ can justify the pause. This is Boyd's central operational insight formalized: in fast-tempo adversarial environments, over-deliberation is fatal not because thinking is bad, but because the environment moves during the thinking.

### Diminishing returns on deliberation

In most models, $\Delta\eta^*(\Delta\tau)$ exhibits diminishing returns — the first moments of simulation yield the largest improvement (identifying the best action from a small candidate set), while additional time yields progressively smaller refinements. Combined with the linear cost $\rho \cdot \Delta\tau$, this implies an **optimal deliberation duration**:

$$\Delta\tau^* = \arg\max_{\Delta\tau} \left[\Delta\eta^*(\Delta\tau) \cdot |\delta_{\text{post}}| - \rho \cdot \Delta\tau \right]$$

At the first-order condition: $\frac{\partial \Delta\eta^*}{\partial \Delta\tau} \cdot |\delta_{\text{post}}| = \rho$.

### Implicit action as the high-tempo limit

As $\rho \to \infty$ or $\Delta\tau^* \to 0$: the optimal strategy converges to **zero deliberation** — pure implicit action from TF-06. This is the mathematical justification for why well-trained systems default to implicit action: the cost of deliberation exceeds its benefit when the model is already good ($\Delta\eta^*$ is small) or the environment is fast ($\rho$ is large).

### Deliberation as an investment

When $\rho$ is low (stable environment) or $|\delta_{\text{post}}|$ is large (the agent faces a significant model-reality gap), deliberation pays off. This formalizes the intuition that deliberation is appropriate for novel, high-stakes, low-urgency situations — exactly the conditions where System 2 thinking is optimal in dual-process theory.

## Connection to Temporal Nesting (TF-08)

Deliberation is itself a *nested loop*: an internal simulation running at some internal clock rate $\nu_{\text{internal}}$ within the external action loop at rate $\nu_{\text{external}}$. The convergence constraint from TF-08 applies: the internal loop must approximately converge before the external loop acts on its output. If $\nu_{\text{internal}}$ is too slow relative to $\rho$, the agent's deliberation produces stale conclusions.

## Domain Instantiations

| Domain | Deliberation | $\Delta\eta^*$ source | When $\rho$ is high |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Boyd's OODA | Explicit "Decide" step | War-gaming, staff analysis | Collapses to IG&C (implicit) |
| RL / MCTS | Planning rollouts | Monte Carlo tree search | Fewer rollouts, shallower search |
| MPC | Online optimization | Trajectory optimization | Shorter horizons, faster solvers |
| Human cognition | System 2 deliberation | Mental simulation, reasoning | Defaults to System 1 (intuition) |
| Organization | Strategic planning | Scenario analysis, committees | "Move fast and break things" |
| Scientific method | Theoretical prediction | Model-based prediction before experiment | Rapid prototyping, fail-fast |

## Open Questions

1. **Computational cost of deliberation** is not just elapsed time but also *resource* cost (energy, opportunity cost of not processing new observations). A fuller model would include both temporal and computational budgets.

2. **Deliberation about deliberation**: The agent must decide *whether* to deliberate, which itself takes time. This meta-deliberation is bounded by the same trade-off at a higher level, suggesting a hierarchy of diminishing deliberation horizons.

3. **Deliberation that *generates* observations**: Internal simulation can surface model inconsistencies (a form of internal mismatch), functioning as "exploration without external action." This blurs the line between deliberation-as-cost and deliberation-as-information-source. Connection to TF-01b's CIY: can deliberation generate *internal* causal information yield?
